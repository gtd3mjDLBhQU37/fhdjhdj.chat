This device has a virus that has corrupted the main mIRC.exe file ... Scan your PC with an antivirus ... We recommend using NOD32 antivirus
The script files responsible for the appearance of shapes and emojis do not work correctly or do not exist.. to solve the problem:
1. Close all previously open mIRC.exe scripts and run the mIRC.exe script again
2. Change the antivirus and then re-download the script ... We recommend downloading Antivirus Nod32
3. Talk to one of the administration officials
